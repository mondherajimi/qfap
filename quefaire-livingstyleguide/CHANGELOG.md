# Changelog

## Versioning system

Let's take the `x.β.α` version number:
* `α` is for small fixes that don't involve any template update, mainly css evolution
* `β` is for versions that need template update for static (html) use of the styleguide and addition of new elements
* `x` is for major release involving a more careful integration of the styleguide

## x.β.α (coming soon)
